# --- Example Usage ---
#
# 1. First, you need to train your `PerceptionModel`.
#    - Generate data by running the env and saving (ray_casts, true_ball_state) pairs.
#    - Train the model on that data and save it: `torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'perception.pth')`
#
# 2. Once trained, you can create the full agent:
#
#    agent = VisualCatchingAgent(
#        perception_model_path='perception.pth',
#        motor_model_checkpoint_path='/path/to/your/rllib/checkpoint',
#        num_ray_casts=20  # Or whatever number you chose
#    )
#
# 3. In your simulation loop:
#
#    obs = env.get_ray_cast_observation() # Your new observation function
#    action = agent.get_action(obs)
#    env.step(action)
